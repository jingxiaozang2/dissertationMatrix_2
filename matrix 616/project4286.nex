An uncertain scoring is used where the anterior region is ambiguously preserved, such as in H. hongmeia ?. This character is scored as present in for the sclerotized structures observed in the head region of Luolishania ? and the Emu Bay Shale Collins’ monster ?, as the morphological similarity with Collinsium strengthens the likelihood that the cephalic sclerites represent a legitimate feature in the former taxon ?. Collinsium bears a pair of discrete subrectangular sclerites on the anterior region ?. Taxa with an incomplete anterior region ? are coded as uncertain.

Recent palaeoneurological data support the homology of the dorsal carapace-like plate in Radiodonta with the anterior sclerite of upper-stem and crown-group Euarthropoda ?.

Previous analyses confused the anomalocaridid ventral flaps with the dorsal flaps carrying setal blades of gilled lobopodians, and euarthropod exites, and were ambiguous about the homology between setal blades in anomalocaridids and euarthropod exites. The wrinkling on the flaps seen in Kerygmachela kierkegaardi and Pambdelurion whittingtoni, the setal blades of Opabinia regalis16 and anomalocaridids, and the exites of the Cambrian biramous limb are considered homologous.

Budd ? discussed the problematic case of interpreting the absence of a circulatory system in Tardigrada as either ancestral or derived given the inherent physical properties associated with a miniaturized body organization, and concluded that a methodologically sound way of addressing this issue in a cladistic analysis is to score this character as inapplicable. In acknowledgement of this issue, the dorsal heart was scored as inapplicable in a secondary iteration of the analysis; however, this resulted in the loss of resolution. Given that there is no fundamentally correct method for scoring the dorsal heart of Tardigrada due to the incomplete understanding of their evolution and overall physiology, this character is scored as absent in order to improve the resolution of the taxa that represent the focus of this study.';

	TEXT CHARACTER=124 TEXT='Yang et al. 2015 ch 84, 2016 ch 84^nRecent fossil data suggest a likely deutocerebral innervation for the mouth in Fuxianhuia and Alalcomenaeus based on the position of the oesophageal foramen relative to the brain ?, which is congruent with the organization found in phylogenetically basal extant Euarthropoda such as Chelicerata and Myriapoda ?; note that although the stomatogastric nerves around the mouth in Pancrustacea originate from the tritocerebrum, this character state is not included given that none of the taxa analyzed display this organization. State 3 reflects the complex neurological organization present in Onychophora; although the jaws have a deutocerebral segmental affinity and innervation, the lip papillae that delineate the mouth opening are formed as epidermal derivates of the three anteriormost body segments, and thus receiver nervous terminals from the protocerebrum, deutocerebrum and part of the ventral nerve cord ?. The tardigrade mouth cone is innervated from the protocerebrum ?. The mouth innervation is coded as protocerebral in Lyrarapax ? based on the position relative to the dorsal brain, and the lack of additional neuromeres integrated into the central nervous system.^nState 2 has been included to reflect the innervation pattern of Triops, in which the stomatogastric nervous system is associated with the tritocerebral neuromere ?.^nScoring for Kerygmachela based on Park et al. 2018';

In fossil representatives, a paired ventral nerve cord has been identified in Alalcomenaeus sp. ? and is confirmed for C. kunmingensis in this study ?. A paired VNC is scored as present for L. unguispinus based on the presence of two descending tracts on the anterior trunk region ?. Although Hou et al. ? have reported the presence of a VNC in the Chengjiang lobopodian Paucipodia inermis, it is not possible to discern whether the organization of this feature is paired or unpaired, and thus it is scored as uncertain pending a formal description of the putative nervous system in this taxon.';

Condensed ganglia are scored as uncertain in Lyrarapax ?, as the preservation of this taxon does not allow the organization of the VNC to be resolved. The lobopodian P. inermis has been described as possessing condensed ganglia ?. Given that the veracity of these observations has yet to be confirmed by additional study of the material, this character is treated as uncertain in the main analysis ?. However, Yang et al. 2016 explored the potential implications of putative ganglia in P. inermis by running a second set of analyses that scored this character as present. Under equal weights and implied weights with k ≥ 20, the analyses produced identical topologies as the original tests ?. However, under implied weights with parameters 20 < k ≥ 0.1, P. inermis was recovered within stem-group Tactopoda ? instead of within stem-group Onychophora.
